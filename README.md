## Hi you ðŸ‘‹

I'm learning how to use GitHub, inspired by the '[7 Days of GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/166411)' initiative that I came across. Until now, I knew GitHub exists and have interacted with some repositories in the past, but never really got around to thoroughly understanding it and properly using it.
I wanted to change that, and felt empowered by this initiative!

Btw, how did you end up here? Feel free to leave a comm[en|i]t!
